You can run it manually using `brew postinstall openssl`
==> Caveats
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the SystemRoots
keychain. To add additional certificates (e.g. the certificates added in
the System keychain), place .pem files in
  /home/monday/.linuxbrew/etc/openssl/certs

and run
  /home/monday/.linuxbrew/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash
